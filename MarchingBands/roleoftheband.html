<h1>The Role of the Band</h1>
<h2>So.... Why have marching bands?</h2>
<h3>School Spirit</h3>
<p>Bands act as the ambassadors of thier schools, representing the institution they come from
  at parades, footgames, and a variety of other events which may be far removed from campus.</p>

<br>  <p>The bands also play the fight song of the school and maintain other tradtions which may be critical to the school's identity and to the experience of student life at that institution.
    Pregame shows tend to be prime examples of this representation, they often are ingrained into the school lore like script Ohio at Ohio State or they have imagery and symbols tied to the school.
    This does not mean that marching bands only carry out the histories of the school, they also set modern traditions such as with Virginia Tech where jumping members of the Marching Virginians who
    began the tradition of jumping to Enter Sandman as the football team enters onto the field.</p>
  <h3>Gameday Atmosphere</h3>
  <p>The presence of the band in the stadium during games means that have a role to play and that role is keeping fans engaged and excited in the goings on of the game.
    Bands play the fight song after a score, have song dedicated to both the offenses and defenses of thier team and will often play popular and fun music during times when nothing is going on and indeed
    the halftime show plays a role in engaging the audience for the time in between halves when they might otherwise drift away or lose involvement with the events of gameday.
     Schools pride themselves on thier gameday experiences and bands play a vital role in creating and maintaining that atmosphere. </p>

  <h3>Homefield Advantage</h3>
  <p> Part of that atmospere's purpose is to win the game at hand. Bands get the home crowd excited then they are able to amp up and cheer on the team towards victory.
    The positive feedback loop of energy between the band, crowd, and players however is not where the band's job ends, indded bands will often have songs with specific purposes. The most obvious of these
    are song which lead cheers such as at Virginia Tech with "block that kick" but msot bands also have extremly loud and discordant piece which they play when the opposing team is near the goal line, in an attempt to distact the players and help thier own defense.</p>
