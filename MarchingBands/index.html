            <h1>Welcome! To a Website about Bands!</h1>
            <p>A marching band according to the Oxford English Dictionary is a "group of musicians who play instruments while marching,
               typically in a parade or at a sports event." The truth of the matter is however that this defintion doesn't encompass
               the aspects of marching bands which make them great. This website will seek to shed some light on the subject of marching bands including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Why bands are important.</li>
              <li>Some of the basic techniques of being in a marching band.</li>
              <li>The history of marching bands.</li>
              <li>Personal experiences from people who participate in band. </li>
              <li>Links to the youtube sites of various bands so you can watch real shows. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope you enjoy exploring!</p>
            <h2>Other Kinds of Marching Bands</h2>
            <h3> Professional Marching Bands </h3>
            <p>The NFL features two marchings bands with the Baltimore Ravens and the Washington Redskins along with dumlines for various other NFL teams. These bands tend to work on a volunteer basis and serve much the purpose as college bands.
          </p>
            <h3>Drum Corps</h3>
            <p>A marching group mainly consisting of percussion and brass instruments along with auxiliaries such as the color guard. Drum corps
            tend to compete at competitions such as those run by DCI (Drum Corps International). These shows tend to be much more ornate than a typical half time show as DCI claims of being the "Major League of Marching."</p>
            <h3>Indoor Drumline</h3>
            <p>Espcially in high school, schools often have a winter program for indoor drumline. While marching band itself ends with football season, members of drumlines may find an indoor drumline program to continue performing.</p>
