<h1> Basic Techniques</h1>
<h2>Posture and Roll Step</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p_AoVIbvxg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> While the basic movement and posture is displayed in the video above, it is important to note that bands may have different versions of the same movement.
  The Marching Virginians for example, when come to attention, "pop" thier heads and bring thier knee up before locking into attention. </p>
  <h2> Drill</h2>
  <p> Drill is the basic form of any given marching band show, consisting of pictures of the field with dots or symbols representing individual members of the band.
    Each individual picture is called a set and the movement of a field perforamance is simply the band moving between pictures, from set to set.</p>
