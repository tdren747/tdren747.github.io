      <h1>Band Experiences</h1>

      <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>

      <blockquote>Band wasn’t my first choice of extracurricular activity coming into high school. I had played trumpet in the middle school concert band, but that was mostly because everyone else in my family had played an instrument at that point and I didn’t want to break the trend. I had played football for years up to that point, when I decided I was too small to try out for the high school team. One day after concert band, the section leader of the trumpets came up to me and asked if I would come to marching band that afternoon, since they had a hole in the show to fill. I agreed, mostly because I didn’t have anything else to do at the time. It turned out to be one of the best decisions of my high school life, as I made most of my friends through the band and gained leadership experience through my time there. I still had a lot of self-confidence issues throughout though, since I was still not particularly skilled at it. My senior year, I made the switch from trumpet to trombone. I had found something I was good at, and ended up auditioning for college band on trombone despite playing it for a significantly smaller amount of time. This was one of the best decisions I have made overall, as through collegiate band and specifically the trombone section I have made some of the best friends I could ask for and developed a work ethic that will last a lifetime.<dd>-Calvin Stanley</dd></blockquote>

      <blockquote>I joined my high school's marching band during my freshman year and never looked back. Over those four years I met a ton of great people, became a better musician, fixed my horrible posture, and finished my high school career as drum major. Once I got to college I was afraid I wouldn't have enough time to continue with the commitment of marching band so I skipped freshman year. I regretted it the whole year and didn't hesitate to try out my sophomore year. The first time I marched into Lane Stadium and performed for thousands of Hokies was one of the greatest experiences of my life and it's what I want to do for as long as I possibly can.    <dd>-Erika Birnbaum</dd></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Being in the Marching Virginians has taught me a lot about music, people, and myself. Having participated in the band for four years in parallel with other band groups at Virginia Tech, my playing skills have improved greatly. By going to band practice every day, I interact with people who I would not meet were it not for our shared interest in music. Going to band is my daily reminder that what I study day to day is not all that exists in the world, and my struggles are not unique. In the 330 other Marching Virginians, there must be someone else who is going through, or has gone through, the same obstacles I am facing. This knowledge centers my perspective and gives me motivation for the next day, knowing that I will end my day by making great music with 330 of my closest friends.<dd>- Peter Owen></dd></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Thirty years from now I will reflect on all of the experiences I had in my four years at Virginia Tech and the majority of them will revolve around my involvement with the Marching Band.  Being in the Marching Virginians at Virginia Tech has granted me once in a lifetime opportunities that are unique to the college marching band experience.  Joining the marching band allowed me to create close friendships with those in my section as well as other strong connections with over three-hundred other Marching Virginian members.  It allowed me to make meaningful and professional quality music with hundreds of talented musicians while also producing visually stimulating half-time and pre-game shows that impressed and entertained over sixty thousand football fans on a weekly basis.  It allowed me to travel to numerous exciting locations for free, with the only cost being my service as a band member which is something I would gladly donate.  Finally, being in the marching band at Virginia Tech gave me a daily escape from the stress and worries that come from being a fulltime college student.  For these reasons I am very thankful for my college marching band experience. <dd> - John-Michael Payne</dd> </blockquote>
